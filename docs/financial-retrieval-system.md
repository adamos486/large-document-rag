The Domain-Specific Financial Retrieval System extends traditional vector-based retrieval with financial intelligence. It understands corporate hierarchies, financial relationships, document structures, and financial entity connections to provide contextually-relevant document retrieval for financial analysis tasks.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Multi-Hop Financial Reasoning**: Follow entity-to-entity relationships across financial documents
2. **Financial Knowledge Graph**: Maintain and query a graph of financial entities and relationships
3. **Hierarchical Document Retrieval**: Navigate document hierarchies based on financial context
4. **Financial Entity-Centric Search**: Search focused on financial entities rather than just documents
5. **Financial Context Preservation**: Retrieve documents with financial context preservation
6. **Cross-Document Synthesis**: Combine information across multiple financial sources

## Architecture Components

### 1. Financial Knowledge Graph

The Financial Knowledge Graph represents financial entities and their relationships to enable sophisticated traversal and retrieval.

```python
class FinancialKnowledgeGraph:
    """Maintains a graph of financial entities and their relationships."""
    
    def add_entity(self, entity, properties=None):
        # Add financial entity to graph (company, subsidiary, product, etc.)
        
    def add_relationship(self, source_entity, target_entity, relationship_type, properties=None):
        # Add typed relationship between entities
        
    def get_related_entities(self, entity, relationship_types=None, max_hops=1):
        # Find related entities via specified relationship types
        
    def find_path(self, source_entity, target_entity, max_hops=3):
        # Find shortest path between entities
        
    def get_entity_subgraph(self, central_entity, max_hops=2):
        # Extract subgraph around central entity
```

**Key Features**:

- Entity types for companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, products, etc.

    """Retrieves documents by following financial relationship chains."""
    
    def retrieve_with_reasoning(self, query, initial_entities, max_hops=3):
        # Start with initial entities relevant to query
        # Follow relationship chains in financial knowledge graph
        # Retrieve documents for each entity in chain
        # Rank retrieved documents by relevance to query
        # Return documents with reasoning chains
        
    def explain_retrieval_path(self, document, query):
        # Generate explanation of how document was retrieved
        # Show entity relationship chain leading to document
```

**Key Features**:

- Chain-of-reasoning explanation for retrieval decisions

### 3. Hierarchical Financial Document Navigator

The Hierarchical Navigator traverses document structures based on financial context.

```python
class HierarchicalFinancialNavigator:
    """Navigates hierarchical document structures for financial retrieval."""
    
    def index_document_hierarchy(self, documents):
        # Identify parent-child relationships between documents
        # Extract table of contents and section structure
        # Build hierarchical index of documents
        
    def navigate_to_section(self, query, document_collection):
        # Find most relevant section in document hierarchy
        # Consider section context and hierarchy
        
    def retrieve_with_context(self, query, document_collection):
        # Retrieve relevant document sections
        # Include parent/child context when needed
        # Return documents with their hierarchical context
```

**Key Features**:

- Document hierarchy representation (report → section → subsection → tables)
- Financial document structure awareness (10-K sections, MD&A, financial statements)
- Navigation by financial concepts and reporting requirements
- Context-aware document section retrieval
- Support for regulatory filings, annual reports, and financial disclosures

### 4. Entity-Centric Financial Retriever

The Entity-Centric Retriever focuses on financial entities rather than documents.

```python
class EntityCentricFinancialRetriever:
    """Performs entity-focused retrieval for financial documents."""
    
    def extract_financial_entities(self, text):
        # Identify financial entities in text
        # Classify entity types
        # Return structured entity information
        
    def retrieve_by_entity(self, entity, document_collection):
        # Find documents containing target entity
        # Rank by entity centrality in document
        
    def retrieve_by_entity_relation(self, source_entity, relation, document_collection):
        # Find documents describing specified relationship
        # E.g., "Subsidiaries of Microsoft" or "Suppliers to Apple"
        
    def consolidate_entity_information(self, entity, retrieved_documents):
        # Extract and combine entity information across documents
        # Resolve conflicts and integrate information
        # Return consolidated entity profile
```

**Key Features**:

- Financial named entity recognition with specialized types
- Entity importance scoring in financial contexts
- Entity relationship extraction from text
- Entity disambiguation in financial contexts
- Cross-document entity coreference resolution
- Entity-based document ranking

### 5. Hybrid Financial Search Engine

The Hybrid Search Engine combines multiple retrieval strategies optimized for financial documents.

```python
class HybridFinancialSearchEngine:
    """Combines multiple search strategies for financial documents."""
    
    def search(self, query, document_collection, strategy="auto"):
        # Analyze query for financial nature
        # Select appropriate search strategies:
        #   - Vector similarity for conceptual queries
        #   - Keyword for specific financial terms
        #   - Entity-based for financial entity queries
        #   - Multi-hop for relationship queries
        #   - Hierarchical for structural queries
        # Combine results with ensemble ranking
        
    def rerank_results(self, query, initial_results):
        # Apply financial domain-specific reranking
        # Consider financial importance, recency, source quality
        # Return reranked results
```

**Key Features**:

### 6. Financial Context Preserver

The Financial Context Preserver ensures retrieved chunks maintain necessary financial context.

```python
class FinancialContextPreserver:
    """Preserves essential financial context when chunking documents."""
    
    def identify_financial_context(self, document):
        # Identify contextual elements (time periods, currencies, etc.)
        # Map context to document sections
        
    def create_context_preserving_chunks(self, document, chunk_size):
        # Create chunks that preserve financial context
        # Include necessary header information
        # Ensure financial table integrity
        # Maintain footnote references
        
    def enrich_chunks_with_context(self, chunks, document):
        # Add relevant financial context to each chunk
        # Include metadata on time periods, currency, etc.
```

**Key Features**:

- Financial context detection in document headers

    print(f"Relevance: {result.relevance_score}")
    print(f"Retrieval Path: {result.retrieval_explanation}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Multi-hop retrieval for complex relationship query
query = "How do supply chain issues with TSMC affect Apple's gross margins?"
entities = ["Apple", "TSMC"]
results = financial_retriever.multi_hop_retriever.retrieve_with_reasoning(
    query=query,
    initial_entities=entities,
    max_hops=3
)

# Entity-centric consolidation
apple_profile = financial_retriever.entity_retriever.consolidate_entity_information(
    entity="Apple Inc.",
    retrieved_documents=results
)

# Knowledge graph exploration
supply_chain = financial_retriever.knowledge_graph.get_entity_subgraph(
