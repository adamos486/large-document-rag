**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: April 4, 2025  

## Overview

The Causal Financial Reasoning Engine enables sophisticated financial analysis through causal inference, scenario modeling, and counterfactual reasoning. It moves beyond correlation-based analysis to understand cause-effect relationships in financial contexts, allowing for what-if analysis, decision impact assessment, and financial simulation.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Financial Scenario Simulation**: Model hypothetical changes to financial variables
2. **Counterfactual Analysis**: Evaluate alternative financial scenarios that didn't occur
3. **Causal Inference**: Identify cause-effect relationships in financial data
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Measure how changes in inputs affect financial outcomes
5. **Decision Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential impacts of financial decisions
6. **Risk Quantification**: Model financial risks and their propagation
